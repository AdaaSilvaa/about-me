        <strong>About Me</strong>
        <p>
        My name is Ada Vianey Silva Espinoza. I am 18 years old and I am a girl who codes from Oakland, CA. I will be in the 12th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to applying to colleges. I live at home with my mom, my stepfather, and my sisters, When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music, painting or wrinting my experiences in life.

        Dislikes: I really do not like when someone treats someone else badly for no reason.
        For me everybody should be treated the same.

        Fun Fact: I love singing, but I have a really bad voice.
